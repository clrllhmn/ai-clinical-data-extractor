# 🏥 AI-Powered Clinical Data Extraction Pipeline

This project demonstrates a prototype pipeline for extracting structured data from unstructured clinical documents using large language models (LLMs). It’s part of my hands-on learning in ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, Responsible AI, LangChain, and Microsoft AI.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal is to explore how AI—especially large language models—can support healthcare data processing by:
- Automating clinical text analysis
- Extracting key fields (e.g., diagnoses, medications, treatment plans)
- Practicing responsible AI use, including prompt design, output validation, and bias awareness

## 🛠️ Features

- Uses OpenAI’s API for LLM-powered text extraction - will utilize a free-to-use educational Jupyter notebook to utilize its OpenAI API key
- Prompt + Output tracking for transparency and reproducibility
- Secure API key handling via `.env` file and `python-dotenv`
- Markdown logs of prompt experiments and results

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- Prompt engineering with real-world healthcare examples
- Building safe, explainable LLM pipelines
- Using GitHub to track learning progress in AI
